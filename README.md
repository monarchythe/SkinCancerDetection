# Skin Cancer Detection

The main aim of this project is to utilize deep learning methods in conjunction with advanced tools such as TensorFlow, Python OpenCV, and the ResNet-50 architecture. This approach aims to create a resilient model capable of accurately discerning between benign and malignant skin lesions through the analysis of medical images.
The key elemts are - 

Data Collection: Assembled a varied and comprehensive dataset of skin lesion images, covering both benign and malignant instances.

Data Enhancement: Employed Python OpenCV to preprocess and refine the images, optimizing their suitability as inputs for the deep learning model.

Deep Learning Architecture: Deployed the ResNet-50 framework using TensorFlow, training it on the processed data to discern distinctive features of diverse skin lesions.

Categorization: Constructed an intelligent classification system capable of precisely categorizing skin lesions as either benign or malignant.

Validation and Evaluation: Assessed the model's efficacy through diverse metrics and techniques to ensure its dependability and efficiency.
